This js file does not require jquery, nor does it convert to HSV format at any time.

Additionally, an html file is included with a script to adjust the background color of a webpage using the time of day. In my demo, the bg color is white at noon, black at midnight, and varyingly gray inbetween. The text and link colors also adjust to maintain readaibilty among the 256 different shades.
